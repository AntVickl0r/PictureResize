# PictureResize
A simple Tool to resize jpeg, png and gif images through the windows explorer context menu.

Copy the PictureResize.exe into your programs folder (or where ever you want) and start it (needs admin rights).

Push the button to (de)activate the contextmenu entry.

Then you can just right-click on any jpeg, png and gif images to start the resize window,
where you can type in the new dimensions and 'save' (overwrites the old image) or 'save as...' (choose destination and filename)
