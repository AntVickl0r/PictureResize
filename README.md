# PictureResize
A simple Tool to resize jpeg, png and gif images through the windows explorer context menu.

[Download PictureResize_setup.exe](https://github.com/AntVickl0r/PictureResize/blob/master/setup/PictureResize_setup.exe?raw=true)

Start the setup and when the app starts, push the red button to activate the context menu entry.
(If you push the button again, wich is green yet, you deactivate the context menu entry).

Then you can just right-click on any jpeg, png and gif images and select 'Resize image' to open the resize window,
where you can type in the new dimensions and 'save' (to overwrite the old image, if you answer the first dialog with yes or save a copy with a _{width}x{height} stamp at the end of the filename, if you answer the second dialog with yes) or 'save as...' (to choose destination and filename).

When you click on Language, you can choose from all language files inside the 'lang' folder (inside the install location you chose). You can create your own translation by copying one of the present .xml files and replace the content of each tag (for example: <LANGUAGE>Language</LANGUAGE> from 'EN.xml' is <LANGUAGE_NAME>Deutsch</LANGUAGE_NAME> in 'DE.xml').
